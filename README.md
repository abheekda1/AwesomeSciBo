<p align="center">Open-source Discord bot that aims to aid up-and-coming Scibowlers with randomly generated (non-stock) rounds and training. It has many features, including subject-targeted training, a cross-server leaderboard, and a plethora of slash commands!</p>

## Deployment

Deploying this bot to your Discord server is relatively simple: you can add it to your own server by
using [this link](https://adat.link/awesomescibo).

## Contributing

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ADawesomeguy/AwesomeSciBo/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation

There are basically two ways to install it:

### Method 1 (Node):

After cloning the repository, dependencies can be installed with `yarn` or `npm i`. The bot can then be compile to
JavaScript with `yarn tsc` or `npx tsc`, and will be deployed in the `built/` directory. Finally, the bot can be run by
entering said directory and running `./index.js` or `node index.js`.

### Method 2 (Docker):

This bot has a Dockerfile within the repository which can be built using `docker build . -t [tag]`. Alternatively and
preferably, the image can be taken from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/adawesomeguy/awesomescibo).

## Usage

This bot uses slash commands now :). You can just click on the bot icon after typing `/` to see a list of commands.

## Credit

The bot was made by [@ADawesomeguy](https://github.com/ADawesomeguy). However, the API was made
by [@CQCumbers](https://github.com/CQCumbers). Go give [his API](https://github.com/CQCumbers/ScibowlDB) a star, he
totally deserves it!
